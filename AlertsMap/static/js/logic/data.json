Most of the stoves (one in the kitchen on each floor) are only partially operational and needs to be replaced. Also insufficient number of fridges (in spite of distribution of four fridge to families with many children last year) is a significant problem. Currently people are simply storing their food next to insufficiently insulated windows, which will not work in the spring/summer. SMM received complaints that the distribution didn't necessary follow vulnerability criteria. We visited two families with 4 and 5 children that had received no fridge while others with 2 were selected.",

Their apartment building needs total rehabilitation and although they may have some short term solutions, they would probably need a medium term option in Collective centre. Most of the Old IDPs (23) that used to live in Elevatornaya Street 19a were relocated to Yakornaia Street 21, where five old IDPs (from 2014) from the Donetsk airport area have been living for two year. The latter group has received aid from RAF but not from ICRC. There are five very vulnerable HHs remaining in Elevatornaya 19 that have nowhere to go and with lack of heating, water and gas (only electricity) and precarious security situation would urgently need to be offered an alternative shelter/CC. Maria Yaldovenka (0990580629), 33 years-old and three weeks away from giving birth to her third child, showed DPH her destroyed house in Degtiarova street 26 that she shares with her elderly mother. Currently staying with family, she lacks the resources to rehabilitate her destroyed home. All the old IDPs were offered some initial psychosocial assistance but would probably need some more systematic follow up in the next few weeks",

So when the shell impacted the north facing wall of her house, created a 2x2 hole in the solid 30 cm+ wall and shrapnel and the pressure wave from the explosion impacted the ceiling and wall in the kitchen breaking the inner glass in the south facing windows of the living room on the other side of the house, where the old woman was sleeping just seconds before. With a RUB 4000/month pension and ICRC food aid distribution every 3 months she’s doing well.

The school is attended by about 400 children. \r\nThe administration of the school informed us that one of the major concerns is the poor condition of the roof. As a result of numerous damages inflicted to the school by shelling, the structures of the roof were misplaced and they are not properly sealed now. This causes fungus on ceilings and walls on the third floor of the school, what poses serious public health concern.

The village is located in the immediate vicinity to the contact line (it is only 1.5 km away from Novoluhanske village, which is controlled by the Government of Ukraine) and therefore, the village is constantly impacted by shelling. \r\nAlthough, Dolomitne is controlled by the armed groups of 'DPR', the village is still considered to be a part of Bakhmut district and therefore all social payments and pensions residents are supposed to receive in Novoluhanske. On 1 January 2017, UAF closed the road between Dolomitne and Novoluhanske villages. Hence, residents of Dolomitne can no longer go there to receive their pensions and/or humanitarian assistance from Rinat Akhmetov Foundation. \r\nAt the moment, the village is completely isolated and “forgotten” as local residents told us. There is no grocery shop, no pharmacy, no hospital and no public transportation. In terms of groceries people depend on occasional visits of relatives who bring them food from near by villages. The phone connection is very unstable. Ambulance does not come to the village. There are two children of school age who attend the school in Novoluhanske and they can go to their school when there is no shelling. Reportedly, only school children and two teachers are allowed to cross the contact line between Dolomitne and Novoluhanske. There is a heavy presence of armed groups and UAF in and around the village that are located very close to each other. The settlement is surrounded by checkpoints and we were reported about regular shelling and sniper activity.",

Reportedly, mother and her son went from their house, located at 27 Moskalevskogo, Marinka down the street to N 12 Moskalevskogo, to the neighbour’s house to get some drinking water as there was no drinking water available in the interlocutor’s house. The boy filled up five liter containers and with his bicycle went back home, while his mother stayed to talk to her neighbour. According to the boy, while walking back home on Moskalevskogo str. he heard shots but could not state the number. He got scared and tried to hide behind the fence and closed his eyes. Suddenly the boy felt pain in his right leg, above the knee and up to his hip. The boy also saw that his right leg was covered in blood. \r\nAccording to the mother, she cleaned her son’s leg and removed the visible splinters out of his leg. She said that she couldn’t take her son to Kurakove’s hospital the same day as it was already dark. The woman claimed that splinters could have been from the explosive bullet that allegedly hit a surface not far from the boy and exploded bullet’s splinters hit the boy’s legs. \r\nThe boy and his mom went to Kurakhove Hospital the next morning on 3.04.2017. According to the mother, the doctor didn’t remove the splinters out of boy’s leg, but cleaned his wound and put the bandage over the injured area. Reportedly, it would have been impossible to find small splinters in the wounded leg and in order not to cause more pain to the patient it was decided not to take the splinters out. According to the mother, the doctor said that some of the splinters would come up on the surface of the leg in time. The mother continued, that her boy felt a pain in his left leg yesterday evening when they returned back home to Marinka. The mother said that she found some damage in the boy’s left leg as well, below the knee. SMM asked how this happened that she and doctor didn’t notice the injury on the left leg yesterday or the day before. The interlocutor said that she was very much under the stress and the boy could not say a word as reportedly he was also depressed and scared. Thus, today, she and the boy were going back to the doctor to Kurakhove, so that the doctor could take a look on the boy’s left leg as well. SMM followed up on the case and called to the woman in the evening. The woman told SMM that it was decided to operate on the right leg and extract three relatively bigger splinters from the boy’s leg on Monday, 10.04.2017 at the Kurakhove hospital. The woman also informed SMM that splinters were also confirmed as found in the left leg.",
